	<h2> Telium - the game (python)</h2>
	<p> Telium [Tel-ee-um] is a text based adventure game based loosely on the films Life (2017) and Alien (1979). The game is coded in a number of stages. Each stage presents you with the base code to type in so you have a head-start and are not so daunted by the enormity of the production. The stage also includes additional challenges for you to extend the code further.
In the game, the player navigates around a space station called “The Charles Darwin” which is made up of a number of interconnecting modules. The object of the game is to find and trap a queen alien called “Telium” that is located somewhere in the station. Not wanting to get into a conflict with humans unless necessary, the queen will attempt to escape to adjacent modules when it is encountered. To win the game, the player must lock the appropriate module in the station so the queen cannot escape. Once trapped it can be killed with a flamethrower. A variety of additional objects are populated throughout the space station to enhance the adventure. </p>
